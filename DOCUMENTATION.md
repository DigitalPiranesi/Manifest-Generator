## Format for Images
Images stored in an IIIF compliant image server are expected to be stored in the
following filename. This is standardized to make the migration easier in the
future. All images and URLs for images should use this format after a manifest
has been generated:

```
{project name}_{2 digit volume number}_{3 digit page number}.{extension}
```

For example, `digitalpiranesi_02_012.jpeg` represents the 12th page of the 2nd
volume of the Digital Piranesi project.
